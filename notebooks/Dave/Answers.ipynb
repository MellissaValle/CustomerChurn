    "The stakeholder is the telecom business. They interested in reducing how much money is lost because of customers who don't stick around very long. If we can accurately identify any patterns, we can minimize the turn rate for the company, and as a result decrease costs associated with losing and having to regrow its customer base. We will be delivering an analysis of what factors go into causing customer churn. Our stakeholder is not constrained to any particular model. We will be able to investigate several different types of models.<br>\n",
    "In our context, a false positive is identifying someone will leave when they actually stay. Alternatively, a false negative would be identifying someone who will stay but they will actually leave. A false negative is much worse for our stakeholders because missing customers that will leave defeats the purpose of the analyzing this data set and developing the model. Missing these customers costs the company more money than a false positive. For thsi reason we will need to optomize our recall score for the models."

    "The data comes from SyriaTel and includes information about their customers. The dataset has customer's state of residence, telephone numbers and length of the account. There are columns indicating if the customer has an international plan and voicemail plan, how many voice mails they receive. The dataset includes how many minutes they spend talking, how many calls they make and how much they are charged during day, evening and night periods. Additionally, the data inlcudes how many customer service calls each customer has made. And, the target variable, the customer's churn status. For our analysis, we will focus on the number of customer service calls each customer makes, what is each customer's total bill and if it affects the likelihood of churn and which states have the highest turn rate."
